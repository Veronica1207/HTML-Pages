        <p>Degas is especially identified with the subject of dance; more than half of his works depict dancers.

In addition to ballet dancers and bathing women, Degas painted racehorses and racing jockeys, as well as portraits. His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and for their portrayal of human isolation.</p>

                <p><strong>The Little Fourteen Year Old Dancer</strong> by Edgar Degas is his most famous contribution to the medium of sculpture. It was completed towards the end of the 19th century. His work with sculpture offered new possibilities for this genre, such as being able to consider the third dimension that had not been possible with his many paintings and drawings of ballet dancers. He experimented with two or three different materials for his sculptures artworks.The final work is an impressive 98cm tall and Degas’ original French title for it was La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans.</p>
