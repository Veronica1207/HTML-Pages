        <h2>Edgar Degas</h2>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Degas" target="_blank"><em><strong>Edgar Degas</strong></em></a> (born Hilaire-Germain-Edgar De Gas, 19 July 1834 â€“ 27 September 1917) was a French Impressionist artist famous for his pastel drawings and oil paintings.</p>
        <p>Degas is especially identified with the subject of dance; more than half of his works depict dancers. Degas was a superb draftsman, and particularly masterly in depicting movement, as can be seen in his rendition of dancers.</p>
